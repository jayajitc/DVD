# Deploying An Open, 3D-Printed IOT Platform For Low-cost, High-quality Weather Sensing

## Introduction




## Purpose
This repository contains the paper and analyses describing the deployment of a 3D-PAWS (3D-Printed Automated Weather Station) [https://www.iepas.ucar.edu/core-programs/3dpaws/
](https://www.iepas.ucar.edu/core-programs/3dpaws/)
 during the 2018 IS-GEO Workshop [https://is-geo.org/2018-training-institute-hawaii/
](https://is-geo.org/2018-training-institute-hawaii/) at the University of Hawaii, Hilo.  In total three (3) 3D-PAWS [2] were deployed into three (3) distinct ecosystems in Hawaii.  The first 4 months of observation data from the Mauna Loa station deployment was collected, archived and analyzed.
